NAME
    Config::Inetd - Interface inetd's configuration file

SYNOPSIS
     use Config::Inetd;

     $inetd = Config::Inetd->new;

     if ($inetd->is_enabled(telnet => 'tcp')) {
         $inetd->disable(telnet => 'tcp');
     }

     print $inetd->dump_enabled;
     print $inetd->dump_disabled;

     print $inetd->config->[6];

DESCRIPTION
    `Config::Inetd' provides an interface to inetd's configuration file
    (usually named inetd.conf); it basically simplifies checking and setting
    the enabled/disabled status of services and also allows for dumping them
    by a given status.

CONSTRUCTOR
  new
     $inetd = Config::Inetd->new('/path/to/inetd.conf');

    Omitting the path to inetd.conf will cause the default /etc/inetd.conf
    to be used.

METHODS
  is_enabled
    Checks whether a service is enlisted as enabled.

     $inetd->is_enabled($service => $protocol);

    Returns true if the service is enlisted as enabled, false if enlisted as
    disabled and undef if the service does not exist.

  enable
    Enables a service.

     $inetd->enable($service => $protocol);

    Returns true if the service has been enabled, false if no action has
    been taken.

    It is recommended to precedingly call `is_enabled()' with according
    arguments supplied to determine whether a service is disabled.

  disable
    Disables a service.

     $inetd->disable($service => $protocol);

    Returns true if the service has been disabled, false if no action has
    been taken.

    It is recommended to precedingly call `is_enabled()' with according
    arguments supplied to determine whether a service is enabled.

  dump_enabled
    Dumps the enabled services.

     @dump = $inetd->dump_enabled;

    Returns a flat list that consists of the enabled entries as seen in the
    configuration file.

  dump_disabled
    Dumps the disabled services.

     @dump = $inetd->dump_disabled;

    Returns a flat list that consists of the disabled entries as seen in the
    configuration file.

  config
    Access the tied configuration file.

     @config = @{$inetd->config};

    Returns an array reference.

INSTANCE DATA
    The inetd configuration file is tied as instance data with newlines
    preserved; it may be accessed via $inetd->config.

BUGS & CAVEATS
    It is strongly advised that the configuration file is backuped first if
    one is intending to work with the default (i.e., system-wide)
    configuration file and not a customized one.

    Accessing `@{$inetd->{CONF}}' is deprecated and superseded by
    $inetd->config.
